task should not lose one atom of credit so justly due them.</p>

<p>Louisiana has a rich cultural heritage dating back over 12,000
years. During these 12,000 years, many different peoples have lived and
worked in the state. Archaeologists, who study the remains of these long
gone people, learn much about their ways of life. The Anthropological
Study series published by the Department of Culture, Recreation and
Tourism provides a readable account of the various activities of these
different groups. <i>Bailey&rsquo;s Dam</i> is the eighth in this series.</p>
<p>The <i>Bailey&rsquo;s Dam</i> volume is somewhat different than its predecessors
in that it highlights a relatively recent event of Louisiana&rsquo;s long
cultural past&mdash;the building of Bailey&rsquo;s Dam during the Civil War. The
research for this volume resulted from work initiated by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg District to record important historical
resources within the Red River Waterway Project. Steven D. Smith of the
Division of Archaeology and George J. Castille III of Coastal Environments,
Inc., the authors of this volume, have taken the technical reports
resulting from this research and have provided a very readable account
of the events surrounding the construction of Bailey&rsquo;s Dam. The Corps of
Engineers funded the publication of this volume.</p>
<p>We are pleased to make the <i>Bailey&rsquo;s Dam</i> story available and trust
that you will enjoy this volume.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>Major General Nathaniel P. Banks, Union commander of the Red
River military expedition, found himself in a particularly tight situation
in April of 1864. He had been defeated at the Battle of Mansfield while
attempting to capture Shreveport, Louisiana, and now he was retreating
down the Red River, harassed by Confederate troops at every turn.
Throughout the campaign, the river&rsquo;s low water level had been a constant
problem to his naval support of gunboats under the command of
Rear Admiral David D. Porter. Now, Banks and Porter discovered that
the river was so low that the gunboats were trapped above the rapids at
Alexandria.</p>
<p>To save the flotilla, Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Bailey suggested
that the river could be dammed to raise the water level and float the
gunboats over the shallow rapids. Despite the doubts and jeers of many,
Banks authorized Bailey to begin construction. Through the next two
weeks, troops struggled to build the dam which eventually made it possible
for the fleet to escape.</p>
<p>In 1976 the archaeological remains of Bailey&rsquo;s Dam were placed on
the National Register of Historic Places, and through 1986, they could
be seen at times of low water. However, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
is constructing a modern lock and dam downstream of this historic
site, and the Red River will permanently cover Bailey&rsquo;s Dam. Recognizing
the historical and archaeological importance of the dam, the Corps
sponsored archaeological excavations there in 1984.</p>
<p>This booklet relates the history and archaeology of the dam complex,
a series of different types of dams collectively called Bailey&rsquo;s Dam.
The story combines the rich annals of the 1864 Red River Campaign
with the finds of modern archaeological investigations. This combination
provides a fascinating glimpse into a desperate period in Louisiana
history.</p>

<p>SIR: I came down here anticipating a move on the part of the
army up toward Shreveport, but as the river is lower than it
has been known to be for years, I much fear that the combined
movement can not come off, without interfering with plans
formed by General Grant....</p>
<p>The Mississippi River is very quiet, and the rebels retreated
into the interior on hearing of the advance of the gunboats.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>With this communication to the Secretary of the Navy, Rear Admiral
David D. Porter foretold the crisis that would come close to destroying
his squadron of gunboats two months later. Low water on the Red
River in early March was an unexpected sight. Since 1855 the annual
spring rise had appeared without fail. But now in 1864, while Porter
waited at the mouth of the Red River for his fleet to assemble and for
Major General Nathaniel P. Banks&rsquo;s army to begin its march north from
Franklin, Louisiana, the Red River&rsquo;s water level was causing Porter to
have doubts about the upcoming campaign.</p>
<p>Doubts concerning the Red River Campaign were shared by other
Federal officers, but for different reasons. The necessity of a thrust up
the Red River in 1864 had been debated since the fall of Vicksburg the
previous year. Generals Grant and Sherman, and even the Red River
expedition&rsquo;s commander, General Banks, believed that the North&rsquo;s next
logical military objective was to capture Mobile, Alabama. But Commanding
General of the Army Henry W. Halleck and President Lincoln
felt that control of Texas was urgently needed to keep Mexico from joining
the Southern cause. The Red River presented the best route to Texas.</p>

<p>There was another underlying reason for the expedition, which may
have changed Banks&rsquo;s mind. The Red River area was rumored to contain
large stores of cotton critically needed by the North. Some historians
feel that Banks&rsquo;s desire to secure this cotton influenced his decision to
promote the campaign, and that the capture of cotton became all important
to him. After the campaign, the Joint Committee on the Conduct of
the War charged that the expedition failed because Banks and Porter
were overly concerned about capturing cotton. How much their attention
strayed is unknown, but it is true that competition between the army
and navy for cotton caused great tension during the campaign. At Alexandria
soldiers were angered &ldquo;to see the navy seizing the cotton for prize
on land, while they did not get any&rdquo; (J.C.C.W. n.d.:18,74).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Whatever the real motivation for the campaign, the official military
objective was Shreveport. Once Shreveport was in Union control, Texas
would lay open to invasion. To capture Shreveport, Banks&rsquo;s army, supported
by Porter&rsquo;s flotilla, would drive up the Red River while another
force under Major General Frederic Steele would move south from
Arkansas.</p>
<p>Opposing the Federal attack in Louisiana
was Confederate Major General
Richard Taylor, who had only
around 6,000 troops scattered
throughout Louisiana in Monroe,
Alexandria, Marksville, and on
Bayou Teche. Badly outnumbered,
Taylor worked to gather his forces
and then waited for reinforcements
from Texas so he could eventually
make a stand.</p>
<p>On March 12, 1864, Porter began
his move up the Red River.
Within three days, he captured Fort
De Russy, near Marksville, with the
help of a detachment of infantry.
Meanwhile, Banks&rsquo;s main army began
its march north from Franklin,
Louisiana, fighting rain and muck.</p>

</div>
<p>The forward units of the army reached Alexandria on March 24.
Arriving as a tired yet conquering army, they had already traveled 165
muddy road miles. Still, &ldquo;the colors were unfurled, the band struck up,
and the men marched through the streets&rdquo; with Banks watching the
troops pass in review from a house veranda (Beecher 1866:298-299).
Once assembled, the Federal forces numbered nearly 30,000 troops, 13
gunboats, and 60 assorted transport vessels.</p>
<p>Here Banks and Porter had their second warning that the Red River
was not going to cooperate. It quickly became obvious that the expedition
would be delayed by the low water at the rapids. Although eventually
the water level rose, the expedition was forced to leave many vessels
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
behind. North of Alexandria, Porter&rsquo;s fleet consisted of only 12 gunboats
and 30 transports. To carry all the supplies needed by the army, wagons
had to be used to make up for the supply boats left in Alexandria. Banks
was also forced to leave behind troops to protect the fleet and the town.</p>
<p>While they waited for the Red to rise, the soldiers and sailors had to
use the water for washing and cooking. As one member of the 114th
New York described it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a dirty, sluggish stream, about the eighth of a mile wide,
flowing in an extremely crooked channel. Its bends and curves
are so exaggerated that they seem almost unnatural....</p>
<p>In all the water charged with mud which our men had been
compelled to drink, they had never before seen anything that
came so near being a compromise between earth and water as
the Red River (Beecher 1866:299-300).</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Naturally, the delays in Alexandria were a godsend to Confederate
General Taylor. Some 5,000 cavalry reinforcements arrived from Texas
to help block the Yankee advance from Alexandria. Now, despite still
being outnumbered, Taylor boldly looked for an opportunity to engage
Banks before they reached Shreveport. As Taylor later related in his
memoirs, &ldquo;My confidence of success in the impending engagement was
inspired by accurate knowledge of the Federal movements, as well as the
character of their commander, General Banks, whose measure had been
taken in the Virginia campaigns of 1862 and since&rdquo; (Taylor 1879:161).</p>
<p>Taylor&rsquo;s opportunity came when Banks reached Grand Ecore, a
landing north of Natchitoches. There, Banks decided that the bulk of his
land forces would approach Shreveport along a narrow road, twisting
away from the Red River and passing through the villages of Pleasant
Hill and Mansfield. This decision prevented Banks&rsquo;s army and Porter&rsquo;s
gunboats from mutually supporting each other during their advance.
The army soon became strung out for some 20 miles along the slender
road Banks chose. Awaiting him near Mansfield on April 8 were Taylor&rsquo;s
smaller but better concentrated forces. In the battle, the tired Federal
troops panicked and were thrown back down the road.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The next day Banks was able to pull his army together. They stood
against Taylor&rsquo;s attack at Pleasant Hill, forcing the Confederates to
withdraw. But despite this success, Banks was left with a disheartened
army that was quickly losing confidence in his leadership. After the
retreat to Grand Ecore, one &ldquo;officer in high position&rdquo; even suggested
putting Banks on a steamer to New Orleans (Hoffman 1877:96-97).</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">RETREAT TO ALEXANDRIA</span></h2>
<p>In spite of his army&rsquo;s loss of courage, Banks wanted to continue the
attack. But realizing that the troops were discouraged, and that General
Steele was not coming down from Arkansas to support the Union attack
on Shreveport, Banks&rsquo;s officers convinced him to fall back to Alexandria.
With this turn of events, the campaign&rsquo;s goal of capturing Shreveport
was all but forgotten. Now the main concern of Banks and Porter was to
get their troops and boats out of the Red River area while keeping their
forces intact.</p>
<p>After Porter&rsquo;s gunboats returned to Grand Ecore from their own
advance upstream, the dispirited soldiers began their retreat. Confederate
General Taylor was now in a position to do real damage to the Union
expedition. Confederate cavalry constantly tormented the retreating
Union forces along the road to Alexandria. Meanwhile, others ambushed
the gunboats along the twisting riverbanks. The river itself resisted the
Federals as the boats continually ran aground in the shallow stream.
One gunboat, the <i>Eastport</i>, was sunk by a rebel mine, refloated, towed,
run aground several times, and finally blown up by the navy, to prevent
her from being captured by Taylor&rsquo;s rebels. Frank Church, a Marine
officer aboard the tinclad <i>Cricket</i>, described what must have been a typical
skirmish during the retreat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had not been fired upon for some time and were all sitting
down not thinking of guerrillas when we were opened on by
about a hundred men. My men sprang to their feet and fired
back. I put two shots through the front door of the house where
there were several men. After I fired three shots our boat
swung around and got aground leaving us without a breastwork.
My men behaved splendidly standing up and firing away
while they were sending a perfect shower of ball and shot over
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
us. As we could not get any opportunity to use our rifles to
advantage I ordered my men to lay down until we swung
around. I sought protection behind the bell but some fellow
saw me and fired at me&mdash;two bullets struck the bell and I concluded
I had better get somewhere else (Jones and Keuchel
1975:48-50).</p>

</div>
<p>Eventually, the army and its naval support made their way back to
Alexandria, where the rest of the Union forces waited. As the weary
Yankees dragged into the town, an officer recorded in his diary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>April 25&mdash;At 3 o&rsquo;clock P.M., to-day, we reached Alexandria, and
encamped on the river, just above the town. The army presented
the appearance of having seen hard service, and a long
campaign. The men were dirty and ragged, some of them shoeless.
Our trains were somewhat dilapidated, the snowy covers
of a month ago were dust covered, and some in tatters; the
horses and mules as nearly fagged out as the men. How unlike
the army which a month ago marched so proudly through the
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
streets of this town (Pellet 1866:229).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By April 28, Banks and Porter had reassembled their forces at Alexandria.
Now the low water dilemma, which had teased and threatened
the fleet throughout the campaign, became a crisis. The water in the
Red had dropped so low that portions of the rocky rapids were exposed,
and at some points, the water was only 3 feet deep. Even the lightest
gunboats needed at least 7 feet of water to pass. Ten of Porter&rsquo;s gunboats
were trapped above the rapids. Unless some means were found to get
them below the rapids, they would have to be destroyed like the <i>Eastport</i>,
otherwise they would be lost to the rebels. While many officers,
including the expedition&rsquo;s formally trained engineers, were preparing
for the disastrous loss of the backbone of Porter&rsquo;s fleet, Lieutenant Colonel
Joseph Bailey was proposing the solution&mdash;a dam.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">JOSEPH BAILEY AND HIS DAM</span></h2>
<p>Military engineer Joseph Bailey&rsquo;s presence with the Red River expedition
was, in a sense, one of those coincidences of history that sometimes
result in turning the course of events. His knowledge of
engineering was not acquired through formal study at West Point. Instead,
he had learned practical engineering on the Wisconsin frontier,
where damming was a skill perfected by lumbermen to float logs to their
sawmills.</p>
<p>Born in Ashtabula County, Ohio on May 6, 1827, Bailey grew up in
Illinois. In 1850 he moved to Wisconsin, where for the next 20 years he
was involved in the construction of dams, mills, and bridges. At the
beginning of the war, Bailey formed a company of lumbermen and became
a captain. Soon, though, his construction genius was recognized
and he was supervising various engineering projects for the North, including
construction at Fort Dix in Washington D.C. and the attempts to
build canals during the Vicksburg campaign.</p>
<p>In 1863 Bailey won distinction at the battle of Port Hudson. There,
despite the scoffs of formally trained military engineers, he constructed
a gun emplacement in full sight of rebel fortifications and proceeded to
silence the Confederate guns. He also built a dam during the siege to
refloat two grounded steamboats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>All this had been accomplished while he was, officially, an officer in
the Wisconsin 4th Cavalry. Recognizing Bailey&rsquo;s talent, General Banks,
without authority, promoted him to colonel. But this promotion was the
right of the Governor of Wisconsin, and it was retracted. Instead, Bailey
was made a Lieutenant Colonel of Volunteers. Bailey was infuriated at
this seeming injustice, and fortunately for Porter&rsquo;s stranded fleet, he had
applied for and received a staff position as engineer for Major General
William B. Franklin, one of Banks&rsquo;s officers.</p>
<p>To Bailey, constructing a dam to float the gunboats over the rapids
was a challenging but not impossible task. After all, he had undertaken
similar work in Wisconsin and at Port Hudson. In fact, he had foreseen
the problem as early as April 9 and offered to construct a dam at that
time. But while Franklin liked the idea, the matter was not yet critical,
and other more important problems needed tending.</p>
<p>Most of the staff officers thought Bailey&rsquo;s idea was outrageous. Porter
had joked about an earlier proposition by Bailey to build a dam to
refloat the stranded gunboat <i>Eastport</i> saying: &ldquo;Well, major, if you can
dam better than I can, you must be a good hand at it, for I have been
d&mdash;&mdash;g all night&rdquo; (Hoffman 1877:99). Now, though, a major part of the
fleet was about to be lost and Porter instructed a messenger, &ldquo;Tell General
Franklin that if he [Bailey] will build a dam or any thing else, and
get me out of this scrape, I&rsquo;ll be eternally grateful to him&rdquo; (Hoffman
1877:101). Later, Porter would record that &ldquo;the proposition looked like
madness, and the best engineers ridiculed it, but Colonel Bailey was so
sanguine of success that I requested General Banks to have it done, and
he entered heartily in the work&rdquo; (Beecher 1866:342).</p>
<p>Fortunately, once Franklin and Banks decided to accept Bailey&rsquo;s
idea, they ordered everyone&rsquo;s cooperation. Some 3,000 troops were put to
work chopping down trees, gathering stones and bricks, and dragging
the raw materials down to where the dam would be constructed. On the
Pineville side of the river, Maine, New York, and Wisconsin soldiers cut
down trees, while on the Alexandria side, black troops were put to work
gathering wood from buildings. One historical account describes the
scene:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Night and day the work was carried on without cessation, the
men working willingly and cheerfully, although many were
compelled to stand up to their waists in water during the
damp and chilly nights, and under a burning sun by day, and
notwithstanding very many had no faith in the success of the
great undertaking.... Oak, elm, and pine trees ... were falling
to the ground under the blows of the stalwart pioneers of
Maine, bearing with them in their fall trees of lesser growth;
mules and oxen were dragging the trees, denuded of their
branches, to the river&rsquo;s bank; wagons heavily loaded were moving
in every direction; flat-boats carrying stone were floating
with the current, while others were being drawn up the stream
in the manner of canal boats. Meanwhile hundreds of men
were at work at each end of the dam, moving heavy logs to the
outer end of the tree-dam, ... wheeling brick out to the cribs,
carrying bars of railway iron to the barges, ... while on each
bank of the river were to be seen thousands of spectators, consisting
of officers of both services, groups of sailors, soldiers,
camp-followers, and citizens of Alexandria, all eagerly watching
our progress and discussing the chances of success (Moore
1868:11-12).</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>In the midst of this furious activity, Bailey was constantly on hand
directing the construction. On site, the soldiers toiled through the day
and night; the slightest disobedience was harshly corrected. Two officers
were even arrested for allowing a barge, which was to be part of the
dam, to sink in the wrong place. Meanwhile, on shore, the dam and
Bailey were the main source of amusement. To most of the navy, half the
army, and much of the townspeople, the dam was a great joke. Word of
Bailey&rsquo;s dam quickly spread to the rebels, who would taunt their enemy
with &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your big dam progressing?&rdquo; (Moore 1868:12). But Bailey
ignored the wisecracks and concentrated on his plan.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">ENGINEERING AND ARCHAEOLOGY</span></h2>
<p>During the Civil War, the rapids at Alexandria were composed of
rocky outcroppings of sandstone and siltstone forming shoals along a
mile stretch of the Red River, even at times of high water. At low water,
the upper and lower ends of the rapids were exposed. Long before the
war, the rapids had been a problem to river traffic. When the water was
low, goods being transported by steamboat up and down the river had to
be unloaded, carried past the rapids by wagon, and reloaded on different
boats.</p>
<p>Numerous ideas had been proposed to improve the river passage;
even the famous Henry Miller Shreve proposed a solution, but no action
was taken. By 1864 the only navigational aid at the rapids was a small
channel cut out of the rocky river bottom. While this was an improvement,
the water was still too low to navigate the rapids during the campaign.</p>
<p>It is a strange twist of history, but we can say that today we know
more about some details of Bailey&rsquo;s dam construction than did the soldiers
who built it. Those men were laboring day and night to build the
dam as quickly as possible. In the confusion and fury of activity, there
was little time for anyone but Bailey to fully comprehend the plan. Today,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
historians have studied the many reports and eyewitness accounts
of the dam construction to piece together what happened. In addition,
careful archaeological excavation of the actual dam remains provided
undeniable evidence of the techniques used. In 1984 a combined historical
and archaeological study was undertaken by a historian from the
Corps of Engineers and archaeologists from Coastal Environments, Inc.
The results of their studies provide a detailed view of the activities at
Bailey&rsquo;s Dam and testify to the magnitude of Bailey&rsquo;s engineering feat.</p>
<p>Historical documents indicate that Bailey first built his dam just
above the lower, downstream rapids. There, the river was around 758
feet wide, and a 10-mile-per-hour current rushed over the shoals. By
constructing the dam at that particular location, he hoped the water
would rise enough behind the dam to allow the gunboats to float over
the upper rapids. Then, with the built-up water pressure, the dam could
be broken through at the proper time and the gunboats could rush over
the lower rapids, carried by the force of the released water.</p>

</div>
<p>Following Bailey&rsquo;s practical nature, the dam was built with any
locally available material readily at hand. To do so, he used different
methods of construction for each riverbank. On the west (Alexandria)
bank, he built the dam of large wooden boxes called cribs. Bailey constructed
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
a number of cribs which were placed side by side from the bank
out into the river.</p>
<p>Archaeologists investigated these structures during a low water
period by carefully digging two small excavation units around partially
exposed crib remains. These units were 4 feet wide and 8 feet long. As
the archaeologists removed the surrounding mud and dirt and exposed
the cribs, they painstakingly recorded the position of each timber and
beam. Afterward they studied their photographs and notes, comparing
their findings with the historical records.</p>
<p>Historical accounts indicate that lumber from Alexandria mills,
homes, and barns was quickly stripped for use in building the cribs.
Bricks, stone, and even machinery were used to fill and anchor the cribs.
Additionally, historical illustrations show that iron bars were placed vertically
in the four corners of each crib, to provide a supporting framework.</p>
<p>The evidence from modern archaeological excavations generally
supports the historical accounts with some interesting variations. Both
lines of evidence testify to the ingenuity of Lieutenant Colonel Bailey.
The excavations revealed that the crib framework was constructed of
hand hewn 4-by-10-inch timbers, which is strong evidence that the lumber
was from nearby buildings. The ends of these timbers were notched
so that they fit tightly together at the corners of the cribs. The corners
were supported by smaller vertical wood posts. However, in the cribs
excavated by the archaeologists, there was no evidence of the iron support
bars. Furthermore, there was no evidence of machinery parts in the
cribs. Instead, they found that the cribs were filled mostly with sand and
mud and only capped with a layer of loose brick and stone. A metal
fragment of a large sugar kettle was also found among this brick and
stone. A sugar kettle was just the kind of loose but heavy object that
could be quickly transported to the cribs for anchoring material.</p>
<p>On the east (Pineville) bank, there were no town buildings to strip
for lumber but there was, quite conveniently, a forest. With abundant
trees available, Bailey constructed a &ldquo;self-loading&rdquo; tree dam. According
to historical diagrams, trees were stacked lengthwise with the flow of
the stream. The upstream treetops were anchored to the river bottom
with stones. The downstream trunks were raised higher than the upstream
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
tops by alternating layers of other logs running perpendicular to,
or across, the stream. This technique presented a dam face of logs angled
upward with the stream flow. As the river was held back by the log
face, the water pressure actually made the dam stronger or &ldquo;self-loading.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>The archaeological investigation of the tree dam was completed in a
manner similar to the excavations at the crib structures. But here a
trench excavation unit was dug. This trench was 22 feet long and 5 feet
wide, and it was positioned parallel to the flow of the river. During these
investigations, the river began to rise, and when the excavation unit was
finally abandoned, the archaeologists were working about 2 feet below
the water level. The field crew was successful in reaching that depth
only with the aid of a water pump. Archaeologists had hoped to excavate
a slice of the dam completely down to its base, but attempts to excavate
deeper were halted when the pump could not keep out the incoming
water.</p>

<p>The tree dam excavations revealed that both pine and hardwood
logs were used and that the tree bark was left intact. The tree limbs had
been cut off, but by observing the knots on the tree trunks, archaeologists
were able to note the direction in which the trees were positioned.
They found that many of the trees were positioned with their tops downstream,
exactly opposite of that shown in historical illustrations. Also,
all of the upstream ends of the trees had been trimmed of their
branches, and their tips had been pointed with an axe. Spaces between
the logs were filled with sand and mud, and the entire structure was
covered with brick and stone. Interestingly, the archaeologists also
found a hewn, octagonal, wood column among the logs. The upstream
end of the column had been rough cut, seemingly to fit into that particular
spot in the tree dam. The column was most likely a mast from a
riverboat.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Together, the crib and tree dam sections did not cross the entire 758-foot
riverbed. A 150-foot gap existed between the two dams. To close this
gap, four coal barges were used. While the remains of these barges were
not found in the archaeological excavations, historical photographs provide
a fairly detailed picture of their appearance. These 24-by-170-foot
barges were sunk in the gap, lying lengthwise with the current, and
more stones, brick, and iron rails were used to anchor them. Braces and
ropes, anchored to the riverbanks, were also needed to secure the barges
against the rising water pressure.</p>
<p>Bailey directed that the second barge from the Alexandria side be
only partially filled with anchoring materials. This was the barge that
he hoped either to ram or blast out of the way, creating a flood that the
gunboats would ride like kayaks. As it turned out, Bailey&rsquo;s idea worked,
but not exactly as he would have liked.</p>

<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">THE DAM WORKS</span></h2>
<p>To the amazement of practically everybody except Bailey, the dam
complex was working. By May 6, the water held by the dam had risen 4
feet. By May 8, the water level was up 5 feet 4 inches. Three of the
lighter vessels even crossed the upper rapids and now waited behind the
dam for the heavier gunboats. As the soldiers worked to finish the dam,
the water continued to build until the pressure against the dam became
tremendous. General Banks feared the pressure would soon burst the
dam, and the next day, at around 5:30 in the morning, one officer &ldquo;heard
a great crashing in the direction of the dam. Jumping out of the blankets
and slipping on my coat, cap, and boots, I ran down to the bank.
The water was rushing through at a great rate&rdquo; (Tyson May 9, 1864).</p>
<p>Two of the barges used in the dam had broken loose, and the water
was gushing through. Porter, seeing the crisis, quickly ordered the gunboat
<i>Lexington</i> to run the gap:</p>

</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The Lexington succeeded in getting over the falls and then
steered directly for the opening in the dam, through which the
water was dashing so furiously that it seemed as if certain
destruction would be her fate. Ten thousand spectators breathlessly
awaited the result. She entered the gap with a full head
of steam; passed down the roaring, rushing torrent; made several
spasmodic rolls; hung for a moment, with a harsh, grating
sound, on the rocks below; was then swept into deep water, and
rounded to by the bank of the river. Such a cheer arose from
that vast multitude of sailors and soldiers, when the noble
vessel was seen in safety below the falls, as we had never
heard before, and certainly have not heard since (Moore
1868:12).</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The <i>Lexington</i>&rsquo;s run was followed by the three gunboats waiting
behind the dam. Had the rest of the fleet been prepared, all of the boats
might have escaped at that time. However, the navy&rsquo;s lack of confidence
in the dam had given way to apathy, and as the released water rushed
through the break, valuable time was wasted as the fleet gathered
steam to attempt the run. Eventually, the water behind the dam fell and
six gunboats still remained trapped.</p>
<p>But the <i>Lexington</i>&rsquo;s adventure had proven that the dam could work,
and troops confidently went back to work. Bailey worried that the dam
would break again and decided to leave the 70-foot gap in the dam as it
was. But this time he added smaller, lighter dams near the upper rapids.
Like the dam sections at the lower rapids, both crib and tree dam methods
were employed. These dams helped channel the water while reducing
the pressure on the main dam. Thus, instead of relying on one dam
to hold back the water until another run could be made, a series of dams
were built to create a deep channel of water along the whole course of
the shoals in that part of the Red River.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, during Coastal Environments&rsquo;s archaeological excavations,
this dam complex at the upper rapids was believed to be destroyed
by modern development. Later, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers conducted an underwater survey, locating what clearly appear
to be parts of these upper works. If so, these submerged dam sections
are preserved so that perhaps someday archaeologists may have an
opportunity to investigate more of Bailey&rsquo;s engineering feat.</p>
<p>While the army labored to build the upper dam, the navy, more
confident of rescue, worked to lighten the loads on the trapped gunboats.
From May 10 through 12, the remaining gunboats above the rapids
struggled through the upper shoals to the pool behind the main dam.
Yet another dam had to be built to refloat a gunboat that got stuck
during this passage. Then on the twelfth of May, the <i>Mound City</i>, the
largest gunboat of the fleet, ran for the gap in the main dam. The previous
scene was repeated, with thousands lining the banks to watch the
excitement. Marching bands played the &ldquo;Star Spangled Banner&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;Battle Cry for Freedom.&rdquo; Like the <i>Lexington</i> before it, as the
<i>Mound City</i> hit the gap, it ground against the rocky river bottom, and
then shot through. The next day all of the trapped vessels lay safely
below the rapids.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">THE CAMPAIGN ENDS</span></h2>
<p>While Federal troops labored to build the dam, Taylor&rsquo;s Confederate
army was not idle. Some rebels continued to harass the outposts around
Alexandria, while others destroyed bridges and blocked roads in an attempt
to entrap the Union forces. Federal boats already below the rapids
were constantly ambushed along the lower Red River as they attempted
to supply the army. In fact, the Confederate soldiers were able to cut off
all navigation on the river for a while, isolating the Yankees.</p>
<p>On May 13, with all the gunboats now safely below the rapids,
Union forces moved out of Alexandria. The Union soldiers left with
mixed feelings. They had been beaten in battle, harassed, and almost
completely destroyed. They were exhausted. Still, they had accomplished
a magnificent feat in building the dam and rescuing the fleet, and some
had even made friends among the townsfolk.</p>

</div>
<p>But for the local population this was a critical time. Rumors spread
that the town would be torched when the army left. Banks ordered a
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
detail of 500 men to be left behind to protect the town from arson. But
fires quickly broke out as soon as the main army was out of town. It is
unclear who started the fires, as some accounts describe soldiers looting
and setting fires, while other accounts note that army guards shot
looters. Probably, both Union troops and local looters were involved. One
detachment, the 92nd Colored Infantry who also helped build the dams,
was known to have fought a fire for many hours, until the building was
doomed and the troops were forced to continue their retreat. One Yankee
soldier described the scene:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cows ran bellowing through the streets. Chickens flew out
from yards and fell in the streets with their feathers scorching
them.... Crowds of people, men, women, children and soldiers,
were running with all they could carry, when the heat
would become unbearable and dropping all, they would flee for
their lives, leaving everything but their bodies to burn. Over
the levee the sights and sounds were harrowing. Thousands of
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
people, mostly women, children and old men, were wringing
their hands as they stood by the little piles of what was left of
all their worldly possessions (Van Alstyne 1910:320-321).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the expedition retreated south down the Red River, Confederate
cavalry did what it could to badger the Union forces at every opportunity.
However, no matter how courageously the men fought, the rebel
army was too small to seriously oppose the retreat of the entire expedition.
At Mansura, Louisiana, Taylor attempted to stand against the Federals,
but after a four-hour artillery duel, he had to withdraw.</p>
<p>Though the campaign seemed about at an end, Banks found that he
had to call on the services of Lieutenant Colonel Bailey once more. At
the Atchafalaya River, Bailey directed the construction of a bridge which
he promptly fashioned out of transport vessels. Around 24 transports
were placed across the river and held together with large timbers. Then,
long planks were laid across the prows of the transports to form a temporary
bridge. Banks&rsquo;s army was able to cross the river quickly and safely
and continue the retreat south to Baton Rouge. By that time, every
soldier knew and appreciated the frontier engineer from Wisconsin.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">EPILOGUE</span></h2>
<p>Measured against the backdrop of the entire Civil War, the results
of the Red River Campaign cannot be considered critical to either side.
Overall, the end of the war simply had been delayed. Some of the Federal
troops on the expedition were from Sherman&rsquo;s army and could have
been of great help to him. Furthermore, an attack against Mobile, Alabama,
which General Grant wanted, was postponed for 10 months by the
Red River escapade.</p>
<p>The campaign had also cost the Union army 5,200 men and 21
artillery pieces. The navy lost some 320 men, two pump boats, one ironclad,
two tinclads, and four transports. Yet Banks still had his army
relatively intact, and just as importantly, the fleet was saved, thanks to
Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Bailey.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the campaign was of tremendous significance to
Louisiana. The invasion brought the war home to thousands of Red
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
River settlers, destroying their property, economy, and lives. Beyond civilian
casualties, 4,000 Confederate troops were lost. On the positive
side, victory at Mansfield and the failure of the Union expedition must
have helped to strengthen Southern resolve.</p>
<p>For Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Bailey, the campaign brought fame.
Porter praised Bailey in newspapers and wrote letters of thanks and
approval. Congress gave Bailey a gold medal, Porter personally gave
him a gold inlaid sword, and other naval officers gave him a silver punch
bowl.</p>
<p>Eventually, Bailey&rsquo;s distinguished military career earned him a promotion
to brigadier general. But after the war, the hero of the Red River
campaign met a tragic end. On March 21, 1867, Sheriff Joseph Bailey, of
Vernon County, Missouri, was murdered by two prisoners he was taking
to jail. Today, Joseph Bailey is buried in Evergreen Cemetery, at Fort
Scott, Kansas.</p>
<p>Historian Michael Robinson best summed up the significance of
Bailey&rsquo;s Dam when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Bailey&rsquo;s Dam was the
toil expended by the Union soldiers.... Through the hot days
and chilly nights they labored diligently despite harassment
from the enemy; the depression and fatigue of a long, failed
campaign.... In many respects, their efforts offer some basis
for Porter&rsquo;s claim that Bailey&rsquo;s Dam was &ldquo;without doubt the
greatest engineering feat ever performed&rdquo; (Robinson 1985:66-67).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, &ldquo;the dam still remains intact as we left it, and bids fair, if
undisturbed, to stand a hundred years&mdash;an imperishable monument of
American energy, ingenuity, and skill&rdquo; (Moore 1868:13-14).</p>
